## Implementation of Microservices

The microservice this project uses primarily is the Client-Server model.

We also wanted a site that had loose coupling, modularity, and separation of concerns. This meant that we also added some features of the Layered Model to achieve these requirements.

## Integration of Microservice

The use of the Client-Server model can be seen whenever a user clicks on any tab.
Any user is the client side and it makes requests of the server for any information, from searching available inventory to checking out.

The loose coupling, modularity, and separation of concerns were apparent in the creation of the different types of clothing tabs.
For future interations of this website, more sub-categories of clothing can be added without influencing the current structure. Or if this site no longer supports to the selling of a category of clothes, its removal will not affect the site.
